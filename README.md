This repository holds the code, final paper write up and final poster for presentation for my CS 229 final project. 

The final project focuses on building machine learning models that accurately identify the activities being performed by individuals 
using their smartphone sensor data. Our team reviewed the performance of the various models, and made suggestions that could improve
future accuracy if another team were to perform similar research. Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques were used
throughout the paper to gain a better understanding of how users behave and how activities differ from one another.
